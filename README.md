Well, I wanted a short and easy method to test my theories about possibly solving the travelling salesman problem. I couldn't find any reliable and user-friendly programs online, so I decided to build my own. Hopefully this reaches the right audience who can appreciate mathematics and the world of computational complexity theory as I do, and can use this program to their own benefit.
